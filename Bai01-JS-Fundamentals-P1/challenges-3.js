// Code challenges 3
//There are two gymnastics teams, Dolphins and Koalas. They compete against each
// other 3 times. The winner with the highest average score wins a trophy!

// Test data:
//     ยง Data 1: Dolphins score 96, 108 and 89. Koalas score 88, 91 and 110
// var dolphins = [96, 108, 89],
//     koalas = [88, 91, 110];

//      ยง Data Bonus 1: Dolphins score 97, 112 and 101. Koalas score 109, 95 and 123
var dolphins = [97, 112, 101],

// var dolphins = [97, 112, 101],
//     koalas = [109, 95, 106];

// 1. Calculate the average score for each team, using the test data below

// team only wins if it has a higher score than the other team, and the same time a
// score of at least 100 points.
